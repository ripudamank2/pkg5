# The two classes which follow are used during dependency calculation when
# actions have variants, or the packages they're contained in do.  The
# VariantCombinationTemplate corresponds to information that is encoded in
# the actions.  Specifically, it records what types of variants exist
# (variant.arch or variant.debug) and what values are known to exist for them
# (x86/sparc or debug/non-debug).  The variant types are the keys of the
# dictionary while the variant values are what the keys map to.
#
# The VariantCombinations class serves a different purpose.  In order to
# determine whether a dependency is satisfied under all combinations of
# variants, it is necessary to track whether each combination has been
# satisfied.  When a VariantCombinations is created, it is provided a
# VariantCombinationTemplate which it uses to seed the combinations of variants.
# To make a single combination instance, for each type of variant, it chooses
# one value and adds it to the instance.  It creates all possible combination
# instances and these are what it uses to track whether all combinations have
# been satisfied.  The class also provides methods for manipulating the
# instances while maintaining consistency between the satisfied set and the
# unsatisfied set.
