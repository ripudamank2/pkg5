"""centralized object for insert, lookup, and removal of files.

The purpose of the FileManager class is to provide a central location to
insert, lookup, and remove files, stored in the download directory of the
client or the file directory of the repo.  It provides a way to change the
way files are placed into the directory structure by allowing for an ordered
sequence of layouts.  The FileManager overlays the layouts on top of each
other.  This means that layouts have certain requirements (described in the
layout module), but allows the reuse of shared directory structures when
possible.  When a file is inserted, it is placed in the directory structure
according to the first layout.  When a file is retrieved, each layout is
checked in turn to determine whether the file is present.  If the file is
present but not located according to where it should be located according to
the first layout and the FileManager has permission to move the file, it
wil be moved to that location.  When a file is removed, the layouts are
checked in turn until a file is found and removed.  The FileManager also
provides a way to generate all hashes stored by the FileManager."""
