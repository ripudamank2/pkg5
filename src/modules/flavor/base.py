                dependency was satisfied, or self.ERROR, meaning the dependency
                wasn't totally satisfied by the delivered files.  The second
                value is the set of variants for which the dependency isn't
                satisfied.

                'delivered_files' is a dictionary which maps package identity
                to the files the package delivers.

                'links' is an Entries namedtuple which contains two
                dictionaries.  One dictionary maps package identity to the links
                that it delivers.  The other dictionary, in this case, should be
                empty.

                'resolve_links' is a function which finds the real paths a path
                can resolve into given a set of known links.

                '*args' and '**kwargs' are used because subclasses may need
                more information for their implementations. See pkg.flavor.elf
                for an example of this."""
