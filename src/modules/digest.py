# pkg(5) uses cryptographic hash functions for a number of tasks. We define the
# default hash function, along with the hash name here. Note that the use of
# hashes in package metadata is *not* governed by this value, since multiple
# hashes are supported for payload-bearing actions in a package.
#
# Some uses of hashes are image-format specific, and may require image version
# increments, in which case the required algorithm is hardcoded where it is
# used, along with with an appropriate comment.
#
# Other uses are essentially volatile, and the hash used has no persistence
# (e.g. saving the hash to a file in a temporary directory, when the hash gets
# regenerated on service restart). For those volatile uses, DEFAULT_HASH_FUNC is
# recommended.
DEFAULT_HASH_FUNC = hashlib.sha1
DEFAULT_HASH_NAME = "sha-1"

# DEFAULT_XXX_ATTRS are the attributes added to actions by the packaging system
# at publication time.
#
# Notably, the hashes we add to an action at publication *do not* need to
# correspond to the hashes we may use to verify action payload during install or
# update, allowing an upgrade path where we could choose to drop publication
# support for a certain hash algorithm, but still retain the ability to install
# actions using that hash.
#
# The order of these lists of attributes is significant only to the
# extent that the repository code will store the file in the repository using
# the first hash value in the list when using the *old* publication model (ie.
# a transaction, with multiple add_file(..) methods to add content)
#
# Otherwise, when publishing, we always store files in the repository
# using the "least preferred" hash for maximum backwards compatibility with
# older packaging tools that expect to be able to find those hashes in the
# repository, but do add additional hashes to the action metadata.
#
# When using the transport to download content from a repository, we use the
# least preferred_hash for file retrieval, but verify the installed content
# using the "most preferred" hash. See get_preferred_hash(..),
# get_least_preferred_hash(..) and get_common_preferred_hash(..)

        original values of that attribute, and the function used
        to compute the hash.

        The pkg.content-hash attribute may be multi-valued. When
        selecting this attribute, a secondary selection will be made
        based on a ranked list of value prefixes. The most preferred
        value will then be returned.

        Normally, payload comparisons should only be made based on
        hashes that include signatures in the extracted data. This
        constraint can be relaxed by setting cmp_unsigned=True. In
        this case, the most preferred hash will be selected first, and
        then we'll check for unsigned versions of that hash on both
        actions. When both actions have that unsigned hash, its values
        will be returned in place of the signed values.

        If no common attribute is found, we fallback to the legacy
        <Action>.hash member assuming it is not None for the new and
        orig actions, and specify hashlib.sha1 as the algorithm. If no
