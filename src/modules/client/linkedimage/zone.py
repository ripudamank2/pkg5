#
# If we're operating on a zone image it's very tempting to want to know
# the zone name of that image.  Unfortunately, there's no good way to
# determine this, and more importantly, there is no real need to know
# the zone name.  The only reason to know the name of a linked image is
# so that we can import linked image properties from the associated
# parent image.  But for zones we should never do this.  When operating
# on zone images we may not have access to the associated parent image
# (for example, when running inside a zone).  So every zone image must
# contain all the information needed to do a pkg operation at the start
# of that operation.  i.e., the linked image information required for
# operations must be pushed (or exported) from the parent image.  We can
# not pull (or import) this information from the parent image (in the
# cases where the parent image is accessible).
#
#
# There are lots of possible execution modes that we can find ourselves
# in.  Here are some of the possibilities:
#
# 1) in a gz operating on /
# 2) in a gz operating on a zone linked image via pkg -R
# 3) in a ngz operating on /
# 4) in a ngz operating on an alterate BE image via pkg -R
#    (not supported yet, but we'd like to support it).
# 5) in a ngz operating on an linked image via pkg -R
#    (this could be a default or user image linked to
#    the zone.)
# 6) in a ngz operating on an unlinked image via pkg -R
#
# The only scenarios that we really care about in this plugin are are 2,
# 3, and 4.  While it's tempting to try and detect these scenarios by
# looking at image paths, private zone files, or libbe uuids, all those
# methods have problems.  We can't even check the image zone variant to
# determine if we're dealing with a zone, since in the future if we want
# to support user images within a zone, it's likely they will have the
# zone variant also set to nonglobal.  There's really one way
# to detect if we're working on a zone image, and that is via the image
# metadata.  Ie, either via a pkg cfg_cache linked image property, or
# via linked image properties exported to us by our associated parent
# image.
